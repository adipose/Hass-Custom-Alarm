Welcome my fellow modders, tinkerers, home assistant wizards!!

Follow the thread [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/yet-another-take-on-an-alarm-system/32386)

Consider donating to this project to keep it going as anything contributed will be placed back in to enable more hardware integration, new features and bug squashing.

This is very much a community project so if you wish to chip in then please do!! I could really use a CSS, animation, design guru to make this look amazing. Also please feel free to leave comments, suggestions, enhancements and fixes!!

### Features:
- Multi Language Support (NEW)
- State specific groups and times (NEW)

[Installation/Configuration Instructions](guidance/configuration.md)

### Testing
- Tested on HA v0.65.5 and below.

### Recent Changelog
- (26/03/18) FEATURE - Multi Language Support!!! English and Portuguese options are available out of the box however you can add your own translations by adding in your own translation file. SO technically you could translated the English GUI to say Esperanto! English is the default. This options is set in your alarm.yaml (language: 'portuguese'). Setting this option prompts the front end panel to look for a json styled translation file with the name of your chosen language saved in www/alarm/language/[your language].json The file must exist and use the json 'style' formatted as seen in the example portuguese file. Each english word in the panel will be translated into a matched translated word. See the portuguese json file as an example.

- (25/03/18) BUG FIX - Moved comments line above the actual config to resolve the hassio issues
- (25/03/18) BUG FIX - Fix to resolve slidebar constantly opening when using mobile devices (Panel 1.0.1 / Bwalarm 1.0.1)

- (24/03/18) A Massive Thanks to those that have donated!!! IT is very much appreciated and helps to keep this project alive. Also keep the suggestions flowing and lets make this the best alarm system ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- (24/03/18) MAJOR UPDATE! - State specific groups/times. Each state must! configure it's own groups. Home and Away are mandatory with Perimeter mode optional. The top level groups have been dropped so you will need to remove these from your alarm.yaml. You will need to update your alarm.yaml!. The ignore/notathome groups have been dropped from the setup. Please see the default alarm.yaml to inform your own setup. An example of the configuration below (if you get stuck then post an issue or ask in the forum):
```
armed_home: #Either home/away with perimeter as optional
  pending_time: 10  #[OPTIONAL] State specific overrides default time
  trigger_time: 600 #[OPTIONAL] State specific overrides default time
  immediate:  #[OPTIONAL however either an immediate or delayed group must exist]
     - binary_sensor.whatever
  delayed: #[OPTIONAL]
     - binary_sensor.whatever
  override: #[OPTIONAL]
     - binary_sensor.whatever
```
- (24/03/18) FEATURE - Added an information button in the bottom right of the panel which shows any detected errors and version information for debugging, needs a little finesse
- (24/03/18) UPDATE - Weather sensor nows supports generic sensors (sensor.weather_summary & sensor.weather_temperature) if these are not found then it will deault to the dark sky sensors (sensor.dark_sky_summary & sensor.dark_sky_temperature)
- (24/03/18) UPDATE - Code cleanup in alarm.html
- (24/03/18) BUG FIX - Removed the need for alarm_script.js (this may re-appear in a later release if we need extra js code) as the hide sidebar feature now natively supports HA close/open sidebar rather than a javascript hack.

- (14/03/18) BUG FIX - UI fix on the sensor groups moving all active sensors into the immediate group when no pending time is set for that particular state.
- (14/03/18) BUG FIX - Custom pending times now accurate set the countdown clock in the panel UI
- (14/03/18) UPDATE - Perimeter Colours added to customisation

## Note!
Beware, here be dragons! There may be bugs, issues whilst I get this off the ground and there will definately be design problems when used with different size browsers etc. Hopefully we can conquer these in due course!..

## Thanks!
Thanks to the community for all the input into this.
